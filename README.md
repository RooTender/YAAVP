# Yet Another Academic Vulcan Project
I just created (*or still developing*) a project that displays a cube in **Vulkan** on **Android** device. Nothing crazy, yet might be useful to get a bit of an insight on how things going there for some folks.

## Features
- The cube is displayed*
- The cube is rotating*
- The cube is transparent*
- Spotlight implementation*
- Spotlight is moving*

*Asterisk means that those features are work in progress...*

## Requirements
- Android Studio
  - The emulator you want (*or just connect to your device*)
  - NDK

## Legal notice
I would have a really hard time without the project template provided from Google. The source to the project it [here](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vulkan-tutorials), I highly recommend to check this stuff. Huge thank you to you guys, keep up the good work ðŸ˜‰!
